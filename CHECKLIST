Here's what we want to do before this tree can become public.  Note that
these things need to be done in the order described here and checked off
when work is completed and tested.  Those numbers with letter suffixes
have multiple parts which can be implemented simultaneously with other
items sharing the number.

-- NOTE -----------------------------------------------------------------
With Mega2k's impending release tonight, we have decided to forgo some
of these features to target a release in the next 24 to 36 hours, sooner
if possible.  Once we have a release a tree with as much of this as we
can tomorrow (stamped as "test tree beta") we will finish it up before
officially commiting it.  Knghtbrd will handle the source availability
till then.

Features which are -'d are not necessary for this quick release.
