1	Special Thanks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The QuakeForge Project would like to thank Id Software, Inc. for writing
and releasing Quake under the GNU General Public License (GPL).  We'd
like to thank John Carmack and Dave "Zoid" Kirsch in particular for the
support they have provided to us and to the Free Software community as a
whole.

We would also like to thank the following organizations for their
contributions to QuakeForge:

   VA Linux Systems, Inc.
   3Dfx Interactive, Inc.

And last but certainly not least, we would like to thank every single
person who has contributed even one line of code, documentation, or
other support to the QuakeForge project.

Without all of you, we would not be where we are right now.

If you'd like to contribute in any way to the QuakeForge project, please
contact our mailing list at quake-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.


2	System Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* A raster-capable display. ;-)
* 16 megabytes of memory beyond operating system footprint.
* A Floating-point processor (FPU). While not strictly required, QuakeForge
  uses a lot of floating-point math, so a FPU is highly recommended.
* 10MB of free hard disk space to build all targets. In addition to the
  base system, you will require game data files. For the default game
  ("Quake"), you will need either the shareware or registered version of
  Quake.


3	Compiling and Running QuakeForge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please read the INSTALL file for more information on compiling.

Autoconf 2.13 or later and automake 1.3 or later are required to use
the bootstrap script, which creates the "configure" script.

After you have compiled successfully, you must download the shareware
version of Quake 1 to play. Insert the proper binaries in the same
directory as the unpacked shareware files, and run.

We are currently working on a free replacement for the Quake game data
files.


4	Platform-Specific Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section discusses issues that affect only certain platforms.

4.1	Linux/Unix

SVGALib-using targets (-svga and -3dfx) can't be started from within the
X Window System. We are aware of the problem, and if you can figure out
the reason, we'd appreciate a patch, PLEASE! As a workaround, you can
use "open" to start those targets from within X.
(example: "open -s -- qf-client-svga")

4.2	Windows 95/98/Me

The MGL-using Windows target (qf-client-win) is unable to use the Alt
and F10 keys. This is caused by a bug in the SciTech MGL library, which
intercepts these key events before the client gets to see them. The
SDL-using targets (currently available from the Borland-compiled
distribution only) do not exhibit this problem, but may have other
issues themselves that we are unaware of.

4.2	Windows NT/2000

For the most part, issues for Windows 9x-based operating environments
will be similar. However, because of numerous differences in the way
Windows NT and Windows 9x operate, these systems may have specific
issues.


5	Errata and Known Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem:  After running the X11 target my keyboard repeat turns off! How
          do I turn it back on?
Solution: xset r on


6	Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If QuakeForge fails to start up, or has problems not addressed elsewhere
in the documentation, try the -safe command line switch, which disables
a number of parts of QuakeForge that can be problems if there are
hardware or configuration problems.  The -safe command line switch is
equivalent to -stdvid, -nosound, -nonet, and -nocdaudio together.  Those
four switches do the following:

  -stdvid	disables VESA video modes
  -nosound	disables sound card support
  -nonet	disables network card support
  -nocdaudio	disables CD audio support

If -safe makes the problem go away, try using each of the switches
individually to isolate the area in which you're experiencing the
problem, then either correct the configuration or hardware problem or
play QuakeForge with that functionality disabled.


7	Technical Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please do not contact Id Software, Inc. regarding technical support
issues related to QuakeForge. QuakeForge is heavily modified from the
original Quake source release and Id Software does not support these
modifications.

Visit the QuakeForge project's webpage for more information on technical
support, bugs reports, and help at: http://www.quakeforge.net/

Thank you.


8	Joystick notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your joystick must be plugged in when QuakeForge is launched.

If you have a joystick plugged in, but do not wish QuakeForge to try to
use it, just add the -nojoy option to the QuakeForge command line.

You may disable joystick reads from the QuakeForge console with the 
"joy_enable 0" command.

There are default configuration bindings for joystick buttons.

If your joystick or interface card reports three or four buttons and you
only have two, use the QuakeForge console command "joy_buttons 2".

The "mlook" and "sidestep" commands work with a joystick exactly as they
do for a mouse, as does the "invert mouse up/down" menu option.
