QuakeForge Coding Style
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You /WILL/ indent with hard tabs, or you will be harmed. :) You can format for
whatever tab spacing you like, but if you indent with spaces you will be hurt
and you will have deserved it. :)

For best results, use 4-space tabs, because that's what id used and what most 
of us use.

Atop each function you write, attach a /* */ comment heading, containing the
name and a short, DESCRIPTIVE summary of the function's purpose. Indent both of
these with one or more tabs. The function is to immediately follow the heading,
with no space between.

The return type should be located on the line previous to the function's name.
This is to facilitate easy searches for a function using the simple regular
expression "^FuncName".

Functions that do not take a value should be explicitly declared to accept void,
not simply ().

Please use the SECTION_ prefix for new functions.

Cross-target prefixes:
IN_	Input
JOY_	Joystick (called by IN_* functions)
R_	Rendering
S_	Sound
VID_	Low-level video

Target-specific prefixes:

CL_	Client
GL_	OpenGL rendering
QFGL_	OpenGL portability aids
SNDDMA_	DMA Sound (called from S_*)
SV_	Server
SW_	Software rendering
x11_	X11R6-specific window handling

SECTION_FunctionName (args)
{

}

For switch statements:

switch (expr) {
	case X:		// foo
		:
		:
		break;
	case Y:		// bar
		:
		:
		break;
	default:	// fallthrough
		whatever;
}
