QuakeForge Coding Style
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You /WILL/ indent with hard tabs, or you will be harmed. :) You can
format for whatever tab spacing you like, but if you indent with spaces
you will be hurt and you will have deserved it. :)

For best results, use 4-space tabs, because that's what id used and what
most of us use.

Each file should have a standard comment, formatted as in the example
below. Please, when you create a new file, make sure you put an ID at
the bottom of the opening comment. This is something special that CVS 
translates into a string that shows information on what version the file
is, when it was last edited, and so on. This is done by embedding
[dollar sign]Id[dollar sign].

All source files MUST #include "config.h" if the symbol HAVE_CONFIG_H
is defined. Likewise, no source file may be compiled multiple times to
produce different object files -- one source, one object.

Atop each function you write, attach a /* */ comment heading, containing
the name and a short, DESCRIPTIVE summary of the function's purpose.
Indent both of these with one or more tabs. The function is to
immediately follow the heading, with no space between.

The return type should be located on the line previous to the function's
name. This is to facilitate easy searches for a function using the
simple regular expression "^FuncName".

Functions that do not take a value should be explicitly declared to
accept void, not simply ().

Please use the SECTION_ prefix for new functions.

Cross-target prefixes:
IN_	Input
JOY_	Joystick (called by IN_* functions)
R_	Rendering
S_	Sound
VID_	Low-level video

Target-specific prefixes:

CL_	Client
GL_	OpenGL rendering
QFGL_	OpenGL portability aids
SNDDMA_	DMA Sound (called from S_*)
SV_	Server
SW_	Software rendering
x11_	X11R6-specific window handling
